# Tic-Tac-Toe

This repository contains two versions of the game tic-tac-toe; the main branch has code for a simple multiplayer version that runs in the terminal, while the update branch has a more complex single-player version, where the user plays against the computer.

### Main Branch

The tic-tac-toe game has been coded in C++ and uses an object-oriented solution, allowing two users to play against each other on the terimal. In the code, the size of the game board can also be adjusted according to user perferences.

### Update Branch 

The tic-tac-toe game has been coded in Python and uses the Pygame Library to provide an interactive interface for the user. The computer uses a minimax algorithm to determine the optimal move in order for the computer to maximise its chance of winning the game.
